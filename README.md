# AMR bioinformatic analysis
 
In this folder, there is the bioinformatic analysis that was followed for the elaboration of the end-of-master work, which consisted of the analysis of antimicrobial resistance genes in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains. 

Antibiotic resistant bacteria are a worldwide problem that, unfortunately, are increasing in number, being a real threat, since if they achieve full immunity to all medicines, we will not be able to fight them and they could kill millions of people. Fortunately, thanks to sequencing processes and bioinformatic analyzes, we can learn about the genetic elements of these resistant strains and develop strategies to combat them. In this work, samples from a hospital published in an article were analyzed. For this work, a bioinformatic analysis of WGS (Whole Genome Sequence) was performed where different tools such as FastQC, MulitQC, Bowtie2, SPAdes, Kraken2, Prokka, Blast, among others, were used. 

For more information about the work, the end of master's work in Spanish is also in this folder.
